## 1. Overview

Our ML testing strategy aims to ensure that:
- Data collection is accurate and consistent
- ML models are properly trained and validated
- ML inferences are reliable and beneficial to users
- ML functionality integrates seamlessly with the rest of the application

The ML system in Hebit serves several key functions:
- Analyzing user behavior patterns
- Providing personalized recommendations
- Optimizing task scheduling
- Predicting task completion times and goal success likelihood
- Identifying productivity patterns and peak hours

## 2. Testing Layers

Our ML testing approach is divided into multiple layers:

### 2.1 Unit Tests
- Test individual ML-related functions in isolation
- Verify data transformations, feature extraction, and utility functions
- Ensure model input/output handling is correct

### 2.2 Integration Tests
- Test the interaction between ML components and the rest of the system
- Verify data flows properly from user actions to ML systems and back
- Ensure ML insights are correctly stored and retrieved from the database

### 2.3 System Tests
- End-to-end tests of the complete ML pipeline
- Verify model training, deployment, and inference processes
- Test system behavior under various conditions and with different user profiles

### 2.4 Validation Tests
- Assess the quality and effectiveness of ML outputs
- Compare ML predictions against actual outcomes
- Measure recommendation quality and user satisfaction

## 3. Data Collection Testing

### 3.1 Context Capture Tests
- Verify that user context is correctly captured during task completion
- Test time of day, day of week, and other temporal features
- Ensure completion patterns are stored with appropriate metadata

### 3.2 Behavioral Pattern Tests
- Test the capture of user behavior patterns over time
- Verify streak calculations and consistency scoring
- Ensure modification patterns are tracked for future analysis

### 3.3 Cross-Entity Relationship Tests
- Test relationships between tasks, habits, goals, and categories
- Verify that entity relationships are correctly captured
- Ensure that changes in one entity affect related entities appropriately

### 3.4 Productivity Metrics Tests
- Test aggregation of daily, weekly, and monthly productivity metrics
- Verify productivity score calculations based on multiple factors
- Test user feedback and rating systems

## 4. Model Training Testing

### 4.1 Training Data Validation
- Verify that training datasets are correctly assembled from raw data
- Test data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Ensure training/validation/test splits are appropriate

### 4.2 Model Evaluation
- Test model performance against baseline models
- Verify model metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- Ensure models are not overfitting to training data

### 4.3 Model Versioning
- Test model versioning and tracking systems
- Verify that model versions can be rolled back if needed
- Ensure new models are properly validated before deployment

<a name="inference"></a>
## 5. Inference Testing

### 5.1 Recommendation Quality Tests
- Test the quality and relevance of recommendations
- Verify personalization based on user history
- Ensure recommendations change appropriately as user behavior changes

### 5.2 Prediction Accuracy Tests
- Test the accuracy of ML predictions for task duration and goal completion
- Verify that predictions improve over time as more data is collected
- Ensure prediction confidence scores are meaningful

### 5.3 Optimization Tests
- Test schedule optimization and suggestions
- Verify that focus time recommendations lead to improved productivity
- Ensure categorization suggestions are accurate and helpful

## 6. Integration Testing Strategy

### 6.1 Controller Integration Tests
- Test ML data collection points in each controller
- Verify that controllers update ML-related fields appropriately
- Ensure ML insights are accessible through the appropriate endpoints

### 6.2 Cross-Controller Tests
- Test ML functionality that spans multiple controllers
- Verify that ML insights from one entity type affect recommendations for other entity types
- Ensure consistent ML behavior across the entire application

### 6.3 API Tests
- Test ML-specific API endpoints
- Verify that ML recommendations are available through the API
- Ensure ML configuration settings can be adjusted through the API

## 7. Test Data Management

### 7.1 Synthetic Data Generation
- Create synthetic user profiles with varied behavior patterns
- Generate realistic task, habit, and goal data
- Simulate user interactions over extended periods

### 7.2 Test Data Versioning
- Maintain versioned test datasets for regression testing
- Ensure test data covers edge cases and rare scenarios
- Verify that test data is representative of real user data

### 7.3 Anonymized Production Data
- When appropriate, use anonymized production data for testing
- Verify that ML models perform well on real-world data
- Ensure privacy and security when using production-derived test data

<a name="monitoring"></a>
## 8. Monitoring and Evaluation

### 8.1 Model Performance Monitoring
- Test monitoring systems for ML model performance
