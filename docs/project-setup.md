## 1. **Project Definition & Requirements Gathering**

1. **Identify Core Features**  
   - **Task Management**: Creation, editing, deletion, categorization, tagging.  
   - **Goal Setting**: Define goals (short-term and long-term), track progress.  
   - **Habit Tracking**: Repetitive tasks or habits, habit streaks, daily/weekly trackers.  
   - **Personalization & Recommendations**: Use analytics to adapt reminders, prioritize tasks, and suggest habits.  
   - **Gamification**: Rewards, badges, levels, streak tracking.  
   - **Offline Capability**: Local cache or local database to support offline usage.  
   - **Multi-Device Sync**: Syncing data across devices when online.  

2. **Define Project Scope & Constraints**  
   - **Scope**: Are you focusing on mobile-first or including web? Depth of personalization algorithms?  
   - **Constraints**: Budget for cloud services (Firebase, AWS), data limits, time constraints for your final-year project.  

3. **Establish High-Level Objectives**  
   - **Enhance Productivity**: Through dynamic scheduling and habit-building features.  
   - **Improve User Retention**: Through gamification and real-time feedback.  
   - **Data-Driven Insights**: Leverage usage data for recommendations and personalized notifications.

4. **Gather Design Inspiration**  
   - Use **Todoist**’s layout and flow as a major reference for tasks and project structure.  
   - Look at **Habitica** for gamification ideas.  
   - Consider smaller elements from **Any.do** or other apps for incremental improvements.

## 2. **High-Level Architecture & Technology Choices**

Your architecture will broadly follow a **three-layer** approach:

1. **Frontend (Mobile App)**  
   - **Language**: Kotlin  
   - **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose, Material Design components  
   - **Animations/Layout**: MotionLayout for transitions, Lottie for animations (optional)  
   - **Networking**: Retrofit for REST or Apollo Client for GraphQL  

2. **Backend**  
   - **Node.js with Express** (for any REST endpoints)  
   - **GraphQL** (preferred for flexible querying and type-safe data structures)  
   - **Socket.io** (for real-time data sync if needed for collaboration or instant notifications)  

3. **Database Layer**  
   - **Primary**: Firebase Firestore (cloud-based, real-time DB)  
   - **Supplementary**: Redis (for caching sessions or frequently accessed data)  
   - **Relational**: AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) for structured data if needed (e.g., user profiles, transactional data)  

4. **Supporting Services**  
   - **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics, BigQuery, Firebase Predictions  
   - **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Firebase Remote Config for A/B testing message content  
   - **Testing/CI**: GitHub Actions, Jest (unit tests for backend), Cypress (end-to-end tests), Firebase Test Lab (mobile testing)

---

## 3. **Detailed Planning & Development Steps**

### Phase 1: **Project Setup & Environment**

1. **Version Control & Repositories**  
   - Create separate repositories (or structured mono-repo) for the **frontend** (Kotlin/Android) and **backend** (Node.js).  
   - Use branching strategies (e.g., Git Flow) to separate development from production.

2. **Local Development Environment**  
   - **Frontend**: Android Studio, Kotlin 1.5+ (or latest stable).  
   - **Backend**: Node.js (LTS version), Express, GraphQL packages, Socket.io, TypeScript (optional but recommended).

3. **Cloud Services Configuration**  
   - Create a Firebase project for Firestore, Authentication (if you use Firebase Auth), Cloud Messaging, Remote Config.  
   - Setup AWS or other relational DB services if required.  
   - Configure Redis locally for caching (or use a managed service like AWS ElastiCache).  

4. **Basic CI/CD Configuration**  
   - Set up GitHub Actions to run lint checks, unit tests on pull requests.  
   - Automate build processes for both backend (Node) and Android app.

### Phase 2: **Requirements Detailing & Technical Specifications**

1. **Use Cases / User Stories**  
   - **User Authentication**: Sign up, login, password reset, social login (if needed).  
   - **Task Management**: Create a task, mark complete, add labels, schedule, archive.  
   - **Habit Tracking**: Define habit, set recurrence, track streak.  
   - **Goal Setting**: Set short-term or long-term goals, progress visualization.  
   - **Recommendation System**: Suggest tasks or habits based on usage patterns (time of day, frequency, completion rates).  
   - **Notifications**: Timely reminders, push notifications for missed tasks, habit streak reminders.  

2. **User Flows & Wireframes**  
   - Draft **low-fidelity wireframes** using software like Figma, Balsamiq, or Sketch.  
   - Sequence common user flows, e.g., “Add New Task” → “Set Due Date” → “Receive Reminder”.  
   - Emulate Todoist’s structural layouts: bottom navigation or top-level navigation, plus floating action button (FAB) for quick task creation.

3. **Database Schema & Data Modeling**  
   - In **Firestore**, define collections for:  
     - **Users**: Basic info (ID, name, email), plus any user preferences.  
     - **Tasks**: Task details (title, description, priority, labels, due date, userId).  
     - **Habits**: Habit info (title, frequency, streak, userId).  
     - **Goals**: Goal details (title, metric, progress, userId).  
     - **Rewards/Badges**: For gamification.  
   - In **Redis**, plan which data to cache (e.g., frequently accessed user tasks, session tokens).  
   - If you decide to use **PostgreSQL** for structured data, carefully plan entity relationships (1:N or M:N for tasks-labels, for example).

4. **API Endpoints / GraphQL Schema**  
   - **GraphQL Queries**: `getTasks`, `getHabits`, `getGoals`—filter by userId, date ranges, etc.  
   - **GraphQL Mutations**: `createTask`, `updateTask`, `deleteTask`, `markHabitComplete`, etc.  
   - **Subscription** (if using GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates): `onTaskUpdated`, `onHabitStreakUpdate`.  

---

### Phase 3: **Frontend Implementation (Kotlin & Jetpack Compose)**

1. **Project Structure**  
   - Adopt **MVVM** or **Clean Architecture** to separate concerns.  
   - Modules or packages:  
     - **ui/** (Jetpack Compose screens)  
     - **viewmodel/** (State management, calling repository methods)  
     - **data/** (Repositories, local DB, remote data sources)  
     - **model/** (Data classes mapping to your GraphQL/Firestore structures)

2. **UI Design & Navigation**  
   - Implement a **bottom navigation** or a **drawer layout** for switching among tasks, habits, goals, and settings.  
   - Use **Jetpack Compose** components: `Scaffold`, `Composable` functions for screens like “TaskListScreen” or “HabitTrackerScreen”.  
   - Build **reusable** composable UI elements, e.g., a standard card layout for tasks.

3. **Offline Functionality**  
   - Use **Room** or **DataStore** to locally store tasks/habits.  
   - Sync with Firestore whenever an internet connection is available.  
   - Handle merge conflicts if tasks/habits were updated offline.

4. **API Integration**  
   - **Retrofit** (if REST) or **Apollo** (if GraphQL).  
   - **ViewModel** → calls repository → fetches data from API → updates UI state in Compose.

5. **Basic Gamification Elements**  
   - Display streak counters for habits in the UI.  
   - Show badges/rewards in a user profile or dedicated achievements screen.

### Phase 4: **Backend Implementation (Node.js & GraphQL)**

1. **Project Setup**  
   - Initialize Node.js project, install dependencies (`express`, `apollo-server-express`, `mongoose` or `firebase-admin` if using Firestore SDK, etc.).  
   - Setup **TypeScript** (optional but recommended) for better type safety.

2. **GraphQL Schema & Resolvers**  
   - **Schema**: Define types for `Task`, `Habit`, `Goal`, `User`, etc.  
   - **Mutations**: Create/edit/delete tasks, habits, goals, user settings.  
   - **Queries**: Retrieve tasks/habits/goals by user or filters.  
   - **Subscriptions** (optional if real-time features are needed): Trigger updates when tasks or habits change.

3. **Socket.io** Integration** (if needed)  
   - Create an endpoint for real-time communications, e.g., “live updates” when tasks are created or completed.  
   - Ensure server can handle concurrency and user authentication over sockets.

4. **Database Layer**  
   - **Firestore**: Use Firebase Admin SDK to handle create, read, update, delete operations.  
   - **Redis**: Cache frequently accessed queries, maintain user session tokens, store ephemeral data.  
   - **PostgreSQL**: If your design needs structured relational data, define schemas and connect using an ORM (Sequelize, TypeORM) or direct queries.

5. **Security & Middleware**  
   - **Authentication**: Use Firebase Auth or JWT-based auth.  
   - **Authorization**: Ensure users can only modify their own tasks/habits.  
   - **Input Validation**: Use libraries like Joi or Yup, or GraphQL’s built-in input validations.

6. **Logging & Monitoring**  
   - Log user operations (task creation, updates) for debugging and usage analytics.  
   - Use Firebase Crashlytics for app-side crashes and a logging library (e.g., Winston) on the server side.

---

### Phase 5: **Algorithmic Adaptation & Intelligent Scheduling**

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Collect user interaction data: completion times, frequency of task creation, streak patterns, notification engagement (did user open the app or snooze it?).  
   - Store usage metrics in Firebase Analytics/BigQuery.

2. **Analysis & Modeling**  
   - Implement a basic **priority scoring** algorithm for tasks (consider due date, importance, user’s historical completion patterns).  
   - Create a **habit recommendation** engine (suggest new habits based on user goals, frequency of successful habits, category of tasks).  
   - Adjust **notification timing**: If the user often snoozes morning reminders, shift them to a later time automatically.

3. **Iterate on Algorithms**  
   - Start simple: static logic or rule-based system.  
   - Gradually incorporate machine learning models if time permits (e.g., using BigQuery ML or a minimal Python-based model).  
   - Continuously test the effectiveness of personalized recommendations (A/B testing via Firebase Remote Config).

---

### Phase 6: **Gamification & User Engagement**

1. **Points & Rewards System**  
   - Assign points for completing tasks or sticking to a habit.  
   - Increment levels or show progress bars.

2. **Badges & Achievements**  
   - Award badges for streaks, monthly completion records, early or on-time task completions.  
   - Show these on a user’s profile to encourage continued engagement.

3. **Streak Mechanics**  
   - Implement daily checks for habit continuity.  
   - Send push notifications to preserve streaks (e.g., “Don’t lose your 5-day run!”).

4. **Optional Social or Team Features**  
   - If you decide to add collaboration, you can use Socket.io for real-time updates on shared projects.  
   - Leaderboards among friends or a small group (optional).

---

### Phase 7: **Testing, QA, and Refinements**

1. **Unit Tests**  
   - **Frontend**: Use JUnit + Espresso (or Compose UI Tests) for UI checks.  
   - **Backend**: Use Jest or Mocha/Chai for resolver and service-level tests.

2. **Integration Tests**  
   - End-to-end flows with **Cypress** or **Detox** (for mobile).  
   - Testing real GraphQL queries against a test Firestore instance.

3. **Performance Testing**  
   - **Load Testing**: Use tools like Artillery or JMeter on your Node.js endpoints.  
   - **Stress Test** your offline sync logic and real-time features with multiple concurrent users.

4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**  
   - Recruit a small group of beta testers (classmates, friends) to use the app for a week or two.  
   - Collect feedback on usability, performance, and feature completeness.

5. **Bug Tracking & Fixes**  
   - Use GitHub Issues or Jira to track bugs, improvements, and tasks.  
   - Prioritize critical bugs that break the core functionality first.

---

### Phase 8: **Deployment & Maintenance**

1. **App Deployment**  
   - **Android**: Generate a signed APK or AAB (Android App Bundle) for the Play Store.  
   - **Beta Distribution**: Use internal testing tracks on Google Play Console or Firebase App Distribution.

2. **Backend & Database Deployment**  
   - Use platforms like **Heroku**, **AWS (Elastic Beanstalk/EC2)**, or **Vercel** (for Node.js GraphQL).  
   - Ensure Firebase Cloud Functions or your Node server is properly configured with environment variables (API keys, DB credentials).

3. **Monitoring & Observability**  
   - Firebase Crashlytics for front-end crashes.  
   - Set up alerts/logging for Node.js on services like AWS CloudWatch or Papertrail.

4. **Iterative Improvements**  
   - Gather analytics on user engagement, retention, and usage.  
   - Plan incremental updates or new features based on real usage data.

## Final Notes

- **Don’t Reinvent the Wheel**: Since you are taking design inspiration from Todoist and other apps, focus on the unique aspects—i.e., advanced personalization and integrated habit tracking. 
- **Keep It Iterative**: You might not get everything perfect the first time. Prioritize core functionalities, then refine. 
- **Scalability & Future Enhancements**: Even if your initial user base is small (just you and some classmates), write your code and structure your data so you can scale if you continue the project after graduation.
- **Stay Agile**: Requirements may shift, especially if you discover new constraints or more efficient solutions. Revisit your plan periodically to adjust as needed.

By following this structured approach—defining requirements, solidifying architecture, iterating through development, and rigorously testing—you’ll have a strong technical foundation for a successful final-year project. Good luck!
