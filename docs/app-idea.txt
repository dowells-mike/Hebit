What
The goal of this project is to develop a highly adaptive productivity app that
combines task management, goal setting, and habit tracking with a unique
level of personalization. The app will use sophisticated algorithms to
analyze user behavior and deliver tailored recommendations, smart
reminders, and dynamic scheduling suggestions. Gamified elements, like
rewards, badges, and streaks, will encourage long-term engagement and
productivity. Additionally, the app will support offline functionality with
data syncing across devices for multi-platform integration.
Why
Most existing productivity apps fall short of offering both comprehensive
task management and habit tracking in an adaptable way. They either lack
personalization or limit their scope to simplistic reminders and lists. My goal
is to design an app that dynamically adapts to individual productivity
patterns, that will provide insights which encourage better time
management and goal achievement. I believe this project will be challenging
while also aligning with my interest in Data Structures, making it the perfect
opportunity to demonstrate what Iâ€™ve learned throughout these years in
Griffith.
How
To achieve this level of complexity, I will implement a three-layer
architecture: frontend, backend, and database, with a focus on algorithmic
adaptation and intelligent scheduling. The following technologies might not
be definitive and I might replace some in the course of my project;
Frontend: Kotlin (with Jetpack Compose), Material Design components,
MotionLayout, Retrofit (API requests)
Backend: Node.js (express), GraphQL API, Socket.io (real time data syncs)
Database: Firebase Firestore, Redis, AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)
Agorithmic Complexity: depends on the particular module of the app. But
the main ones are: smart task prioritization, habit recommendation and
notificiation timing adjustments based on usage patterns.
Analytics: Firebase Analytics, BigQuery, Firebase predictions
Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging, Firebase Remote Config
Testing: Github Actions, Jest and Cypress, Firebase Test Lab
